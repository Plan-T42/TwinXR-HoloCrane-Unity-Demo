# TwinXR: HoloCrane Unity Demo

TwinXR is a method we developed to explore the synergies between Digital Twins (DT) and Extened Reality (XR), and their interoperability and interchangeabilty, by introducing an ontology-based approach in industrial Extended Reality (XR) applications. This project provides the source codes associated with our publication: Tu, X., Autiosalo, J., Ala-Laurinaho, R., Yang, C., Salminen, P. and Tammi, K. TwinXR: Method for using digital twin descriptions in industrial eXtended reality applications. Frontiers in Virtual Reality. 2023; [https://doi.org/10.3389/frvir.2023.1019080](https://doi.org/10.3389/frvir.2023.1019080)

This Unity project creates a TwinXR-compatible Windows Mixed reality Application running on Microsoft HoloLens 2 device for operating overhead cranes. The application accesses and utilizes the Twinbase and the DT documents defined there in the "[TwinXR: Twinbase for HoloCrane](https://github.com/Plan-T42/TwinXR-TwinBase-for-HoloCrane)" project. Together, they demostrate the use of the "TwinXR" method in industrial applications.

## Prequisites

- [Unity 2020.3.8f1](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive)
- [NET 4.6 equivalent and C# 7.3](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.3/Documentation/Manual/CSharpCompiler.html)

The project was developed and tested on Windows 10 and [Microsoft HoloLens 2 (Trimble XR10 Edition)](https://go.trimble.com/XR10-Construction-OrderForm.html). 

## Installation 

Download the [Unity 2020.3.8f1](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive). 
If you have mutiple versions of Unity installed, [Unity Hub](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GettingStartedInstallingHub.html) is suggested.

Clone source code.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Plan-T42/TwinXR-HoloCrane-Unity-Demo.git
```

Open the proejct folder with Unity 2020.3.8f1.

## Run the demo application in Unity

You are all set!

Select the scene ("Crane_DTdoc_QR-code.unity") from the [Project Window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingTheEditor.html).

When you are located in the selected scene (you should find the scene name in the [Hierarchy window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingTheEditor.html), press play, and wait for the system to initialize. 

## Deploy the demo application to Microsoft HoloLens 2

Follow the Microsoft documentation page ["Build and deploy to the HoloLens"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/develop/unity/build-and-deploy-to-hololens).)
