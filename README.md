# TwinXR: HoloCrane Unity Demo

TwinXR is a method we developed to explore the synergies between Digital Twins (DT) and Extened Reality (XR), and their interoperability and interchangeabilty, by introducing an ontology-based approach in industrial Extended Reality (XR) applications. (Related publication is coming out, and we will add the link here.)
