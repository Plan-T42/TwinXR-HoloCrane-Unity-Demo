# TwinXR: HoloCrane Unity Demo

TwinXR is a method we developed to explore the synergies between Digital Twins (DT) and Extened Reality (XR), and their interoperability and interchangeabilty, by introducing an ontology-based approach in industrial Extended Reality (XR) applications. (Related publication is coming out, and we will add the link here.) 

This Unity project creates a Windows Mixed reality Application running on Microsoft HoloLens 2 device for operating overhead cranes. The application accesses and utilizes the Twinbase and the DT documents defined there in the "[TwinXR: Twinbase for HoloCrane](https://github.com/Plan-T42/TwinXR-TwinBase-for-HoloCrane)" project. Together, they demostrate the use of the "TwinXR" method in industrial applications.

## Prequisites

- [Unity 2019.3.0f6](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive)
- [NET 4.6 equivalent and C# 7.3](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.3/Documentation/Manual/CSharpCompiler.html)
